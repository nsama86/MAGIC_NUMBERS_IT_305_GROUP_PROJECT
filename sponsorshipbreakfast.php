								Every year here at the Kent Food Bank we hold our largest fundraiser.  It is called the Annual sponsorship breakfast.  This is a great opportunity to be able to
                                support the food bank, while having a good time too!  There are all sorts of events that are going on.  We have local speakers giving presentations, raffles, and
                                so much more!  The breakfast is held at <a href="http://www.kentcov.org" target="_blank">Kent Covenant Church</a> each year and is a great way to help support those who really
                                need it in our area. Come join the fun and help support your community in a big way!
