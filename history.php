								<p>The Kent Food Bank began operations in 1970 as a temporary agency to serve Kent families during an economic recession. It has since grown into a permanent agency, providing for basic needs, food, clothing and shelter to thousands of families yearly.</p>
								<p>The Kent Food Bank is one of the founding agencies in developing South County Area Human Service Alliance (SCAHSA) whose mission is to streamline access to human services for low-income individuals and families in South King County by locating
										multiple providers in a single site known as the Alliance Center, thereby leveraging resources and increasing efficiency.</p>

								<p>In the fall of 2004 the Kent Food Bank moved into the Alliance Center. In addition to this facility we operate the Birch Creek Food Bank on the east hill of Kent. This supports our efforts to ensure that low-income families or </p>
								<p>individuals that need assistance will have ease of access to our services. One of our major goals is to alleviate hunger in our service area, making for a healthy and strong community.</p>
