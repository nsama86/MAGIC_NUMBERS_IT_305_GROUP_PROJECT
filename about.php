								<p>Here at the Kent Food bank it is our goal to be able to provide services for the community that truly make a difference in our neighbors
								   lives ever since we began operations in 1970. We have two convenient locations that include everything from providing food assistance to
								   those in need, a clothing bank to keep warm, and as well as financial assistance to those who need it.</p>
								<blockquote class="align-right">"Let's help build a better future today!"</blockquote>
								<p>When you walk into one of our convenient locations you will be able to get into contact with one of our volunteers here at the food bank.
								   From there we will be able to set you up with the services that you will need and in a timely manner.  You can find our hours
								   <a href="event-calendar.php">here</a> as well as the various convenient locations that we have
								   available for the Kent community.</p>
								<p>We are here to provide you with services that may help you with what you may need.  That is our mission.  We hope that with our help
								   that we will be able to help bring our community the help that it deserves.  Letâ€™s help build a better future today!</p>
